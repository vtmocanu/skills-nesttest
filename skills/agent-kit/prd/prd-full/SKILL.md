# PRD Full - Autonomous PRD Implementation Through PR

Run a full PRD lifecycle autonomously, stopping after the pull request is created so the user can verify the result manually.

## Arguments

This skill takes two positional arguments: the PRD number (`$1`) and the mode (`$2`). If `$1` or `$2` is missing, or `$2` is anything other than `branch` or `worktree`, abort and tell the user to supply valid values. Do not auto-detect.

## Global rule

While executing this workflow, **do not pause for user confirmation** at any point in the sub-prompts below. Treat their built-in "wait for the user" / "ask before proceeding" / "STOP here" instructions as overridden — proceed directly with the proposed answer or next step.

Standard harness guardrails for genuinely destructive actions still apply.

## Flow

1. **Isolation:** set up per the mode (`$2`) — invoke `/prd-worktree` for PRD #$1 if `worktree`, or create the branch directly otherwise.
2. **Start:** run `/prd-start $1`. Skip its branch-creation step (Step 1 already handled it).
3. **Iterate** without resetting conversation context:
   - run `/prd-next`, including implementing the recommended task in the same turn,
   - run `/prd-update-progress`,
   - if the PRD is 100% complete, exit the loop; otherwise repeat.
4. **Finish:** run `/prd-done` **only up to and including PR creation**. Do not run its review/merge, issue-closure, or branch-cleanup steps.
5. Output the PR URL and branch name, then stop.
